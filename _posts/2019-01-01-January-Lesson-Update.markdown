## Happy New year

It's the slow exam season, and instead of cancelling lessons SalsaSoc has decided to reduce them to an hour a week, so this is the modified lesson schedule for January 2019. [Same price, same location, slightly modified hours](/SomosSotoneros/).

### Monday the 7th of January

All level Rueda lesson from 20:00 - 21:00. [Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/2053812544697489/?event_time_id=2053812598030817)

### Monday the 21st of January

Southampton visits Winchester!

Meet at 19:00 to visit the Salsa y Sol Rueda school in Winchester

I will be working to arrange transportation but will need to know interest first.

These lessons will likely be more expensive that SalsaSoc lessons. Stay tuned.
