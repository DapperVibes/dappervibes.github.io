This website and blog come out of the inspiration I've felt attending classes on the evolving Rueda concepts that are being worked on around the globe. Much of it traces back to the Rueda Standard [http://rueda.casino](http://rueda.casino), but in order for something to be standardized, it needs to be no longer in flux.

This site will host three separate but related pages.

1. A website for Rueda Lessons in Southampton [Somos Sotoneros](/SomosSotoneros)
1. A website for the performance group [Somos Sotoneros](/LosSotoneros)
1. A blog of Rueda concepts. Much of modern Rueda structures is still a work in progress. Hence the name for my blog "Rueda in Progress."

I hope you will find the content here useful. Please feel free to reach out to me at [LosSotoneros@gmail.com](mailto:LosSotoneros@gmail.com).

Rueda love,

Craig Dolder
