This website and blog come out of the inspiration I've felt attending classes on the evolving Rueda concepts that are being worked on around the globe. Much of it traces back to the Rueda Standard [http://rueda.casino](http://rueda.casino), but in order for something to be standardized, it needs to be no longer in flux. Much of modern Rueda structures is still a work in progress. Hence the name for my blog "Rueda in Progress."
