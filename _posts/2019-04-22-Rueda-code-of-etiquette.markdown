I have long struggles with complaints from dancers when people join a rueda where advanced or group specific calls were being used. Either the rueda needs to stop to kick the intruders out or the calls need to be reduced to the lowest common call set, usually dame, enchufa, and prima. All the cantantes I know want rueda to be inclusive, but I know they also want it to be challenging to their students. I have long taught in my classes that you need to seek the permission of the caller before entering a rueda. Now I am proposing the following rueda code of eetiquette, or for short the "rueda code." If all rueda groups adopted similar teachings we would no longer run into conflicts between new students and existing students on the dance floor.
