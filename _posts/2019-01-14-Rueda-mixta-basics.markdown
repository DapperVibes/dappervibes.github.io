In the cold New England winter of 2016 Boston Rueda dancers under the leadership of Jos√© Barretto started playing with an "inside/outside" Rueda structure. Through collaboration at the Ruedafest Stolkholm with Sassan Ito and Linda Ky from Berlin the Rueda structure Mixta was born.

In Rueda Mixta two alternating teams dance together, one facing inside (Pa'dentro) and the other outside (Pa'fuera). These two Ruedas interact in three different ways.

#### 1. "Mixta" changes in teams

In this mode of Mixta, follows from the pa'fuera couples move on the inside of the Rueda while the leads for those couples stay still. At the same time the pa'dentro couples change like normal. This results in two circles forming that alternate between leads and follows in the middle of the move. This is clearly shown in the SalsaNor Rueda Standard video below.

1. "Mixta" changes in the partner teams
2. "Circular" moves where the partner moves around ![alt text](/assets/RuedaMixtaCircular.png "Circular moves")
3. "Pequena" moves that occur between adjacent couples that involve the follows changing teams. ![alt text](/assets/RuedaMixtaPequena.png "Pequena moves")
