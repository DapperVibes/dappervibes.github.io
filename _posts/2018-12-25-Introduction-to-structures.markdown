Rueda structures are the latest evolution in Rueda de Casino. A structure is a change in framework for the Rueda, in which traditional Rueda moves can be called. The moves are the partner changes and the structure is the frame on which the couples sit. Here is a collection of diagrams for different Rueda structures. Where I have written articles describing the structure I've linked the article to the images below.

<div style="text-align: center">

While I appreciate the artistry of theses structures, I also view them a scientific or programming point of view. The structure defines how the couples and their transitions relate to each other. Each structure has an enchufala, but that framework defines who moves where when it is called.

In this new paradigm a normal Rueda (Rueda pa'dentro) is a structure and on top of that structure is layered the Rueda calls. Therefore the only rule associated with the Rueda pa'dentro structure is that, in a Dame style move, the leads move to the follow to their right.

Other structures such as Mixta, redefine partner changes for a subset of the dancers. An enchufala in Mixta requires the follows to move in half of the couples, so the structure redefines an element of all basic Rueda calls, acting as a modifier to those calls.

A detailed description of each of these structures along with many helpful videos can be found on the [Boston Rueda website](https://bostonrueda.com/social-rueda-structures/). I will be gradually adding on articles with my own unique perspective on each structure here, along with notes on the their evolution.
