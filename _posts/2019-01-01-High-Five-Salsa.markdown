### Background

I visited UK's High Five Salsa for ringing in 2019. This school is run by Diego Fuentes Utrilla and Noe Roderick and is based in Dorking, which is nearish Gatwick. It wasn't that easy to get to by public transit from Southampton, but three trains and a bus got me to town. Noe & Diego have hit the international scene hard lately with their [passion for Rueda Switch](#Switch), teaching in Boston, Playa Del Carmen, and soon in Bergen, Norway.

Beyond their teaching they also put on a mean party. I was honored to help them set up for the New Year's bash. Not only do they have a great DJ setup (with Diego setting up the sound system and Noe managing the playlist) but they bring a full suite of Latin percussion instruments so dancers can jam with their favorite tunes when they aren't on the floor. They also led everyone in a Spanish New Year's tradition of eating 12 grapes on the 12 chimes of midnight.

### A passion for switch
{: #Switch }

I first learned Rueda switch from Ethan Wagner of (Wherever he teaches now) in Trondheim in 2017. Noe and Diego take it to the next level. Rueda switch is when moves are called that turn the leaders into follow and the follows into leads. Therefore everyone in the Rueda dances both parts. Combining a wide variety of existing moves and coining many of their own they have expanded the adoption of and variety within this niche. Switch is now being called socially across the globe and continues to grow in popularity. If you can't make it to one of their classes locally or internationally don't worry, they are working to share their knowledge with the wider Casino world through a series of videos, here's a teaser they made.
