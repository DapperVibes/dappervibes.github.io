The 2017-2018 Los Sotoneros teams represented the UK in the WADF Rueda de Casino World Championships in Malaga, Spain. Below are the videos of the first and second round!

The first round was an improvised called Rueda. There were five possible songs the team could perform to and they chose the song out of a hat immediately before heading on to the stage. Here is the performance.

The final round consisted of a rehearsed choreography. The video of the performance can be found below, though the audio is unfortunately out of sync with the video.
