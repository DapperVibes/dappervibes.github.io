### For social ruedas:

-	Always watch a rueda before joining and ensure you know the moves being called.
-	If a rueda is above your level and you don’t recognise the calls do not join
-	Make eye-contact with the caller (cantante) and wait for them to indicate you can join.  
  o	Many advanced ruedas require even couples.  
  o	The caller may be practicing very specific moves or combinations.  
	o If not invited, wait until the song has finished and ask the Cantante to call another at your level.  
-	If you miss a move do not risk hurting your partner by rushing through the move, return to the basic and observe what others are doing. Get ready to catch the next call or partner change.
*	Do not bring a partner into the rueda who does not know rueda de casino!
*	Do not invite a partner to social dance and then join the rueda. Obtain consent from your partner before joining the rueda.
*	Don’t leave the rueda mid-song unless you are leaving with a partner.
*	If your shoelace is loose shout “Cordones!” Everyone else can feel free to imitate typing their laces while you secure yours.


### In class:

*	The instructor is the boss.  
  o	You may know the move by a different name; follow the name used.
	o You may think there is a better way to do/teach the move; you are not the instructor.  
  o	The instructor may modify the move to better fit the class or a progression.  
*	Arrive to class on time.
*	Arrive to class in clean clothes and take a shower before class if needed.
*	Don’t talk while the instructor is talking.
*	Don’t back-lead moves. Unless you are a teaching assistant avoid teaching your partner.
*	Don’t assume you are correct and everyone else is mistaken.
*	Enjoy class!
