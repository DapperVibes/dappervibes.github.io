## What is Rueda de Casino?

Rueda de Casino is a dynamic social dance that can be described as a cross between barn dancing and Salsa. It comes from Cuba and every move you learn here can help with your Casino or Salsa style for partner dancing. No partner is necessary as dancers are constantly changing partners throughout the dance.

## Why Rueda.Life and [Rueda in Progress](ruedainprogress)?

I have the greatest respect for the [Rueda Standard](rueda.casino) and felt that there needed to be a complimentary site for Rueda concepts still under evolution. I also draw a lot of inspiration for Jos√© Barretto and [Boston rueda](https://bostonrueda.com/). This website is a place for articles and perspectives on the evolution and state of the art in Rueda de Casino and I hope others will contribute insightful articles over time.
