## July 2021 Update
Hi All, I'm slowly starting to dust off the website in the hopes of returning to social dance. The future is still uncertain, but I'm still looking forward to our next dance.

## What is Rueda de Casino?

Rueda de Casino is a dynamic social dance that can be described as a cross between barn dancing and Salsa but is neither. It comes from Cuba, is based on the social dance Casino, and every move you learn here can help with your style for partner dancing. No partner is necessary as dancers are constantly changing partners throughout the dance.

## Why learn Rueda de Casino?

* Great exercise for your body and fun activity
* Exercise your mind and keep up with the calls
* Dance relieves stress
* Increases social confidence for any dance floor
* Great way to meet new people

## Why Rueda.Life and [Rueda in Progress](ruedainprogress)?

I have the greatest respect for the [Rueda Standard](rueda.casino) and felt that there needed to be a complimentary site for Rueda concepts still under evolution. I also draw a lot of inspiration for Jos√© Barretto and [Boston rueda](https://bostonrueda.com/). This website is a place for articles and perspectives on the evolution and state of the art in Rueda de Casino and I hope others will contribute insightful articles over time.
