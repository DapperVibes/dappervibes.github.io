One of the greatest pains in the world of Rueda de Casino is when a group of casineros are in a rueda practicing non-standard (or advanced) moves and someone crashes their rueda. Many of us have been there many time. Almost instantly the rueda is reduced to the lowest common denominator, a rueda consisting of dame, enchufa, prima, dame dos, un fly. It is my belief that this doesn't have to happen. It is a result of poor etiquette and traces back to where and how rueda de casino is taught. Below I propose a code of conduct for rueda classes, and if more teachers adopted this, we would no longer have problems with others crashing ruedas.
