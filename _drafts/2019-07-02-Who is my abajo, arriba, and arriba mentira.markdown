As you all know, I love the logic behind rueda calls and one topic that I find particularly fascinating is the wide variety of partner changes that can be applied to the same move. I'm going to focus here on four partner change directions that can be applied to almost any rueda move. This is my personal philosophy based on discussions with many different rueda instructors and it may be your local cantante calls these differently. Please let me know what you think of my logic.

* Abajo (also known as a normal Dame move)
* P'arriba (a change going up the rueda)
* Abajo mentira (Normal Dame direction, but a lie! But don't stand still.)
* P'arriba mentira (Another lie, but it's far from standing doing nothing)

Positioning 1 - Guapea

This is probably the rueda position that people are most familiar with, yet these directional calls can still cause confusion. The figure below shows what partner the red lead goes to in each call. An Abajo move (Dame) means you are going to the follow to your right (sometimes known as la vecina) and it ends in a Dile Que No (DQN). A P'arriba move means you are going to the follow to the left of your current partner and ends in a DQN.  An Abajo mentira move ends in Guapea without a DQN. A P'arriba mentira move ends with exactly the same partner, but involves going to the other side and launching into a DQN. An Enhufa p'arriba mentira ends with the lead doing a left turn on 5-6-7 then turning back to the original partner for the DQU. For Prima the lead typically passes under the arm as if going to the next partner and does a lead's left turn to the DQN. *Include a video of these variants?*

Position 2 - Cubanito

There are a couple moves that will put you in this same positioning such as Manolin or Patin. This is one level of abstraction from a normal Guapea position, but the same rules apply. The figure below shows which follow the lead ends up with after each move. An Abajo change and a P'arriba change and with a DQN with the follows to the right and left respectively. Both of the mentira moves end up with the follow behind the lead, abajo with a right turn without a DQN, a p'arriba with left turn and ending in a DQN.

Position 3 - Al medio

Al medio places the leads between two follows. In this case your abajo and p'arriba mentira changes end with the same follow. Similarly an abajo mentira and p'arriba end with the same follow. This is illustrated below.
