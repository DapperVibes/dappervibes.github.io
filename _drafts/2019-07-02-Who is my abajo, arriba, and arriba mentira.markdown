As you all know, I love the logic behind rueda calls and one topic that I find particularly fascinating is the wide variety of partner changes that can be applied to the same move. I'm going to focus here on four partner change instructions that can be applied to almost any rueda move. This is my personal philosophy based on discussions with many different rueda instructors and it may be that your local cantante calls these differently. Please let me know what you think of my logic.

In order for a rueda call to work you need a move (<span style="color:red">Dame, Enchufa, Prima</span>) and a direction (<span style="color:red">Abajo</span> or <span style="color:red">Arriba</span>). In addition to that you can add a modifier, in this case <span style="color:red">Mentira</span> (a lie). Since <span style="color:red">P'abajo</span> is considered the default direction, it's often dropped. So, when you hear the call <span style="color:red">Dame</span>, it's actually short for <span style="color:red">Dame p'abajo</span>. Similarly, since <span style="color:red">Dame</span> is the most common partner change many cantantes just call  <span style="color:red">P'arriba</span> meaning <span style="color:red">Dame p'arriba</span>.

# The four combinations of the directions and the modifier mentira are:

* <span style="color:red">P'abajo</span> (Down the rueda and the default direction in open position)
* <span style="color:red">P'arriba</span> (Up the rueda)
* <span style="color:red">P'abajo mentira</span> (Down the rueda, but a lie! You still need to move.)
* <span style="color:red">P'arriba mentira</span> (Another lie, but it's far from standing doing nothing)


## Positioning 1 - Guapea

This is probably the rueda position that people are most familiar with, yet these directional calls can still cause confusion. The figure below shows what partner the black clothed lead goes to in each call.
* A <span style="color:red">P'abajo</span> move means the lead goes to the follow to their right (sometimes known as <span style="color:red">la vecina</span>) and it ends in a Dile Que No (DQN).
* A <span style="color:red">P'arriba</span> move means the lead passes to the follow to the left of their current partner ending with DQN.
* A <span style="color:red">P'abajo mentira</span> move starts like the normal move, but ends in Guapea <u>without</u> a DQN.
* A <span style="color:red">P'arriba mentira</span> move ends with exactly the same partner, but involves the lead going to the other side and launching into a DQN. An Enhufa p'arriba mentira ends with the lead doing a left turn on 5-6-7 then turning back to the original partner for the Dile Que No. For Prima the lead typically passes under the arm as if going to the next partner and does a lead's left turn to the DQN.

## Position 2 - Manolin

There are a couple moves that will put you in this same positioning such as <span style="color:red">Cubanito</span> or <span style="color:red">Patin</span>. Here the lead is directly in front of the follow. This is one level of abstraction from a normal Guapea position, but the same rules apply. The figure below shows which follow the lead ends up with after each move. A <span style="color:red">P'abajo</span> change and a <span style="color:red">P'arriba</span> change end with a DQN with the follows to the right and left respectively. Both of the <span style="color:red">Mentira</span> moves end up with the follow behind the lead, <span style="color:red">P'abajo</span> with a right turn without a DQN, a <span style="color:red">P'arriba</span> with left turn and ending in a DQN.

## Position 3 - Al medio

<span style="color:red">Al medio</span> places the leads between two follows. In this case the <span style="color:red">P'abajo</span> and <span style="color:red">P'arriba mentira</span> changes end with the same follow. Similarly an <span style="color:red">P'abajo mentira</span> and <span style="color:red">P'arriba</span> end with the same follow. This is illustrated below.
