# A tale of structures

In 2016 a large variety of new Rueda Structures started popping up in the rueda world. It didn't take long for cantantes to decide that switching between structures made rueda look more like a caleidoscope than ever. Hence the term has come to be known for any series of calls that can switch between different structures. Below is a diagram that includes the same eight couple rueda twelve times. The definitions of what counts as a unique structure are a little grey, but I would say the figure covers eight modern rueda structures and the calls that transition between them. This is to launch a series of blog posts, over which I will describe rueda structures, their short history, and the calls that can transition groups in and out of them.
 
# One big warning

I want to make a very clear note before going any further. Since rueda structures have developed significantly in the last four years, this is very much a concept in progress, so what I post here may not only be done differently across the globe (as is so often the case in rueda) but there could be a earthshattering revelation at the next congress or RuedX that will change things completely. I'm going to try to keep up here, but no guarantees. In the following posts I will discuss each of the transition moves, break them down with diagrams, and try to rally enough dancers to put together short videos. If you find these posts helpful please let me know. I also welcome and suggestions of topics you would like to see covered in future posts.

Without further delay, a short graphical summary of the some popular modern rueda structures.
